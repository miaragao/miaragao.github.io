      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey! Hmm&amp;hellip; This is weird! I am on the other side now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually I&amp;rsquo;m reading the words of others but today it&amp;rsquo;s different. I&amp;rsquo;m actually feeling powerful. I can say whatever I want to almost everyone in the world&amp;hellip; I just don&amp;rsquo;t get why I didn&amp;rsquo;t start this project before! Right now you might be starting to understand how crazy I am but I can asure you that I try really hard to look normal around other people so feel free to get in touch with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to give you an overview of my non-blogger life (basically till yesterday) I can say that I&amp;rsquo;m crazy about coding and new technologies, mainly web development, and I have been playing tennis since I was 4 years old. Although I do not compete anymore I still coach little deamons on Saturdays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of today my life just got better because I found out blogging is awesome (kudos to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/spf13&#34;&gt;@spf13&lt;/a&gt;)! I know I&amp;rsquo;m not an expert on blogging tools but damn this one looks sexy and it is so nice to use! I strongly recommend you to snoop it around and I wish you can have as much fun as me - &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;gohugo.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
